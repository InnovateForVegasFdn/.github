## History

As of 16 June 2022, the Code for Vegas Foundation formed as a Nevada Nonprofit Corporation, and is renaming itself to the *Innovate for Vegas Foundation*, which you may refer to casually as Innovate for Vegas and at the public website, innovateforvegas.org, but which conducts business as Innovate for Vegas Foundation.

As of 12 October 2022, we have received our 501(c)(3) determination from the IRS. Note that during our legal name-change process, that some financial transactions and documentation will refer to our organization as the *Code for Vegas Foundation* until all aspects of our legal name change and records updates are completed.

As of 17 November 2022, our GitHub Team for nonprofit status was approved and we changed our GitHub Organization name from CodeForVegas to InnovateForVegas. There is a legacy CodeForVegas organization that we will maintain to avoid errant commits and other confusion, directing those looking for us to our new org url here.
